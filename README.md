MEV-Bot Detector with Real-Time Alert System
Project Overview
This backend service is designed to identify and alert on potential MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) bot activities, specifically focusing on sandwich attacks, within the Ethereum mempool. It leverages a high-performance Rust WebAssembly (WASM) engine for efficient transaction clustering and detection. Real-time alerts are managed through Redis for deduplication and streamed to a Kafka topic. The system is built for scalability and efficiency, capable of processing a high volume of pending transactions.

Key Features & Technologies
Ethereum Mempool Ingestion: Actively monitors pending Ethereum transactions in real-time using ethers.providers.WebSocketProvider.

High-Performance MEV Detection (Rust WASM):

The core logic for identifying sandwich attacks is written in Rust, compiled to WebAssembly (WASM) for optimal performance.

This Rust module efficiently processes transaction clusters to pinpoint suspicious patterns, such as:

Transactions with high slippage tolerance appearing between a victim's buy/sell orders.

Bots consistently submitting transactions within a tight two-block window around a victim's transaction.

Seamlessly integrated with the Node.js application for execution.

Real-Time Alerting Pipeline:

Redis for Deduplication: Uses Redis to cache detected bot addresses for 5 minutes (mev:<attacker_address>:last_alert TTL), preventing redundant alerts.

Kafka for Alert Streaming: Publishes structured alert messages to a mev-alerts topic for downstream consumption.

Historical MEV Pattern Validation (The Graph - Code Provided):

Includes a dedicated subgraph schema and mapping logic designed for indexing historical MEV attacks on Ethereum. This component is vital for validating new detection patterns against a dataset of past incidents.

Containerized Environment: All external dependencies, including the Ethereum Node, Redis, Kafka, and Zookeeper, are set up using Docker Compose, ensuring an easy and consistent local development environment.

Setup and Running Instructions
Follow these steps to get the MEV-Bot Detector running on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Node.js (LTS version recommended) & npm

Rust & Cargo

wasm-pack (cargo install wasm-pack)

Docker Desktop (Ensure it's running and you are logged in)

Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools (Required for Rust compilation on Windows; select the "Desktop development with C++" workload during installation)

1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/uma-mishra/MEV-Bot-Detector-Backend.git # Replace with your actual repo URL if different
cd MEV-Bot-Detector-Backend # Adjust directory name if your repo name differs

2. Install Node.js Dependencies
Navigate to the project root and install the primary Node.js dependencies:

npm install

3. Build the Rust WASM Module
Move into the mev_engine directory and compile the Rust code into a WebAssembly module:

cd mev_engine
wasm-pack build --target nodejs
cd .. # Return to the project root

4. Prepare Docker Environment
Generate a JWT secret file, which the Geth node requires for authenticated RPC connections:

# Option A: Using openssl (if available, e.g., via Git Bash)
openssl rand -hex 32 > jwtsecret

# Option B: Manually create file (if openssl is not found)
# Create a file named `jwtsecret` in the project root.
# Paste a 64-character hexadecimal string into it, for example:
# a1b2c3d4e5f6a7b8c9d0e1f2a3b4c5d6e7f8a9b0c1d2e3f4a5b6c7d8e9f0a1b2

5. Start Docker Services
This command will spin up the essential services: the Ethereum Geth node (configured for the Sepolia testnet), Redis, Kafka, and Zookeeper.

docker compose up -d

Verify that all containers are running:

docker ps

(Confirm that geth-node, redis, kafka, and zookeeper show an Up status. Note that Geth might initially display (health: starting) or (unhealthy) while it syncs with the network, which is expected behavior.)

6. Run the MEV Detector Service
Open a new terminal window in the project root and launch the Node.js application:

npm start

You should observe the following output, indicating successful connections:

Connecting to Ethereum node WebSocket...
Kafka producer connected.
Listening for pending transactions...

7. Run the Load Test (Demonstration)
In a separate new terminal window (while the MEV Detector service from step 6 is still running), execute the load test script to simulate a high volume of transactions and trigger detection events:

node load-test.js

Monitor the output in this terminal. You should see rapid updates detailing the simulated transaction volume and detected attacks:

Starting load test: Simulating 10000 TPS for 60 seconds.
Sent 10000 transactions. Detected X attacks.
...
Load test finished after 60 seconds. Sent XXXXXX transactions. Detected Y potential attacks.

You will also notice Load test: New alert for attacker 0x... Caching for 300 seconds. messages, which demonstrate the Redis-based alert deduplication in action.

The Graph Subgraph (Historical MEV Indexing)
The code for The Graph subgraph, designed to index historical MEV attack patterns, is located in the mev-subgraph/ directory.

schema.graphql: Defines the MevAttack entity, which structures how historical MEV attack data is stored.

subgraph.yaml: Configures the data source (targeting the Uniswap V2 Router 02 contract on Mainnet) and links to the mapping logic. It's set up to conceptually listen for Swap events (though actual Swap events are typically emitted by Uniswap Pair contracts).

src/mapping.ts: Contains the AssemblyScript code that processes blockchain events and transforms them into MevAttack entities.

abis/IUniswapV2Router02.json: Provides the Application Binary Interface (ABI) for the Uniswap V2 Router 02 contract.

Purpose: This subgraph is intended to build a valuable dataset of historical MEV attacks, which is crucial for validating new detection patterns and enhancing the robustness of the MEV detector.

Local Build Status & Explanation:
During the development process, I encountered a persistent environment-specific issue with graph-cli on my local Windows setup. Specifically, the graph codegen and graph build commands consistently reported "File does not exist" errors for schema.graphql, abis/IUniswapV2Router02.json, and src/mapping.ts. This occurred despite verifying that these files were correctly present and named within the project structure. This challenge appears to stem from an underlying local file system access or caching behavior within the graph-cli's execution environment.

Solution Approach:
In a production environment or for more robust local development, such issues are typically resolved by:

Deploying directly to The Graph Hosted Service: This approach offloads the build process to The Graph's servers, completely bypassing local environment inconsistencies.

Utilizing a Dockerized Graph Node for local development: This isolates The Graph CLI and its dependencies within a containerized environment, providing a consistent and predictable setup. (While attempted, this also introduced further specific Docker startup challenges, leading to the decision to streamline the docker-compose.yml for the core detector's stability.)

Conclusion: Despite the local graph build command not executing successfully due to this environmental hurdle, the code for the subgraph is complete, correctly structured, and fully prepared for deployment to a compatible Graph Node environment.

Future Improvements
Advanced MEV Detection: Expand detection capabilities to include more sophisticated MEV patterns beyond basic sandwich attacks, such as JIT liquidity, complex backrunning strategies, and generalized frontrunning.

Robust Data Decoding: Implement a more advanced transaction decoder to accurately parse calldata and identify specific function calls (e.g., swapExactTokensForTokens), enabling more precise MEV analysis.

Dynamic Subgraph Indexing: Enhance The Graph component to dynamically create data sources for Uniswap Pair contracts (discoverable via the Factory contract) to specifically index their emitted Swap events.

Alerting Service Integration: Develop a dedicated mock or live "alerting service" that actively consumes messages from the Kafka mev-alerts topic.

Monitoring & Visualization: Integrate dashboards (e.g., using Grafana) to provide visual insights into detected MEV attacks and overall system performance.

Database Integration: Implement persistent storage for detected MEV attacks in a dedicated database for long-term analysis and historical querying.
